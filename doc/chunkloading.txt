One possible optimization for chunk loading would be to load the chunks in the
direction the player is traveling first (and gradually). This would spread out
the time chunks are loaded in, potentially leading to less lag when crossing
chunk boundaries.

To potentially create the gradual unloading and the immediate loading of chunks
I could implement a chunk queue. It would be such that if a chunk was told to
be written, then it would be added to the queue to be written. If the chunk was
requested, then all chunk writing would be temporarily paused, allowing for a
potential decrease in lag as we aren't trying to read and write chunks at the
same time. Moreover, if a chunk-read was requesed for a chunk in the to-write
queue, it could be pulled immediately from there, saving time.
